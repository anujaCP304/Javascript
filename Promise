//Promise
//The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and 
//its resulting value.

//Why we use promise:  to manage situations where you must wait for the outcome of an operation. 
//For example, uploading files to the server and awaiting the response of an API call, 
//or just asking the user to choose a file from their computer

//A Promise is in one of these states:
//pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
//fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
//rejected: meaning that the operation failed.

const p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    let a = 1 + 2;
    if(a == 2)
    {
        resolve("success");
    }
    else
    {
       reject("failed");
    }
})

p.then((message) => {
    console.log("inside then " + message);
}).catch((message) => {
    console.log("Inside catch " + message);
}).finally(() => {
    console.log("This will be always executed");
})


//setTimeout() method sets a timer which executes a function or specified piece of code once the timer expires.
//Return value
//The returned timeoutID is a positive integer value which identifies the timer created by the call to setTimeout(). 
//This value can be passed to clearTimeout() to cancel the timeout.

const p2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const value = setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Inside setTimeout");
        resolve("Resolved");
    }, 5000);

    console.log("Timeout value : " + value);
})
