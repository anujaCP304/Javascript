//Template Literals use back-ticks (``) rather than the quotes ("") to define a string:

const text = `Hello Catchpoint!`;

//With template literals, we can use both single and double quotes inside a string:

const text1 = `"She's working at the catchpoint"`;

//Template literals allows multiline strings:

const text2 =
`JavaScript (JS) is a cross-platform, 
object-oriented programming language 
used by developers 
to make web pages interactive`;

//Template literals provide an easy way to interpolate variables and expressions into strings.
//The method is called string interpolation.
