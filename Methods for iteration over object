//How to iterate object properties
//Method 1 : Using for in loop
//-->This loop is used to iterate over all non-Symbol iterable properties of an object. 
//Some objects may contain properties that may be inherited from their prototypes. 
//The hasOwnProperty() method can be used to check if the property belongs to the object itself. 

for (let key in employee1) {
    if (employee1.hasOwnProperty(key)) 
    {
        value = employee1[key];
        console.log(key, value);
    }
}
//Output :
firstName Anuja
lastName Mane
age 24


//Method 2 : Using Object.entries() method
//Object.entries() method is used to return an array of the objectâ€™s own enumerable string-keyed property pairs. 
//The returned array is used with the map() method to extract the key and value from the pairs
Object.entries(employee1).map(entry => {
    let key = entry[0];
    let value = entry[1];
    console.log(key, value);
});


//Method 3: Using forEach() method and object.keys() Method
//Object.keys() returns an array of keys of the object and 
//forEach() is an array method that allows you to iterate over each element in the array.
Object.keys(employee1).forEach(key => {
    const value = employee1[key];
    //console.log(`${key}: ${value}`);
    console.log(key,value);
});
